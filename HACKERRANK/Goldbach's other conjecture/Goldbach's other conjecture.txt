It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.
9=7+2*1^2
15=7+2*2^2
21=3+2*3^2
25=7+2*3^2
27=19+2*2^2
33=31+2*1^2
It turns out that the conjecture was false as you'll discover some values can't be represented as a sum of prime and twice a square. 
You are given N, print the number of ways N can be represented as a sum of prime and twice a square. 
Example 15 can be represented in two ways as 15=7+2*2^2 and 15=13+2*1^2
